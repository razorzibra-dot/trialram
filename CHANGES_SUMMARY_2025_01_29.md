### ✅ State Management
**New States Added**:
```typescript
loadingCustomers: boolean
loadingProducts: boolean
selectedCustomer: Customer | null
saleItems: SaleLineItem[]
selectedProductId: string | undefined
```

**New Interface**:
```typescript
interface SaleLineItem {
  id: string
  product_id: string
  product_name: string
  product_sku: string
  product_description?: string
  quantity: number
  unit_price: number
  discount: number
  tax: number
  line_total: number
}
```

### ✅ Event Handlers
- `handleCustomerChange()` - Updates selected customer
- `handleAddProduct()` - Adds product to line items
- `handleRemoveItem()` - Removes product from sale
- `handleUpdateItemQuantity()` - Updates qty and recalculates
- `handleUpdateItemDiscount()` - Updates discount and recalculates
- `calculateTotalFromItems` (useMemo) - Calculates grand total

### ✅ Data Loading
**Before**: Single load with generic error  
**After**: 
- Separate customer and product loading states
- Better error handling
- Graceful response format handling

- Active status filter for products

---

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- Added line items state management
- Introduced SaleLineItem interface
- Enhanced effect dependencies
- New calculation memoization
- Improved form validation

### Integration Points
- Customer Service: `getCustomers()`
- Product Service: `getProducts()`
- Product Sale Service: `createProductSale()`, `updateProductSale()`
- RBAC Service: Permission checking (unchanged)

### Response Handling
- Handles array response: `Customer[]`
- Handles object response: `{ data: Customer[] }`
- Graceful fallback to empty array

### Calculations
```typescript
Line Total = (Unit Price × Quantity) - Discount + Tax
Grand Total = Sum of all Line Totals
```
