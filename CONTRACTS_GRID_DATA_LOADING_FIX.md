# Contracts Grid Data Loading Fix

## Problem Summary
The Contracts page dashboard was showing contract statistics (2 contracts) in the stat cards, but the main grid table was displaying no contracts - appearing completely empty.

This was identical to the customer grid issue that was previously fixed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Location
**File:** `src/modules/features/contracts/hooks/useContracts.ts`

### What Was Wrong
The `useContracts` hook was returning the raw React Query result directly:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
export const useContracts = (filters: ContractFilters = {}) => {
  const contractService = useService<ContractService>('contractService');

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: contractKeys.list(filters),
    queryFn: () => contractService.getContracts(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
};
```

This returned an object like:
```typescript
{
  data: PaginatedResponse<Contract>,  // Contains: { data, page, pageSize, total, totalPages }
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: any,
  refetch: function,
  // ... other React Query properties
}
```

### How Component Expected Data
The `ContractsPage` component was trying to destructure data as:

```typescript
const { contracts, pagination, isLoading, refetch } = useContracts(filters);
```

But these properties (`contracts`, `pagination`) didn't exist at the top level - they were nested inside the `data` object!

### Comparison with Working Implementation
The `useCustomers` hook in the customers module was correctly structured to extract and return data:

```typescript
// CORRECT PATTERN (from customers)
export function useCustomers(filters: CustomerFilters = {}) {
  // ... uses Zustand store to persist state
  const query = useQuery(...);
  
  return {
    customers,        // Extracted from store
    pagination,       // Extracted from store
    isLoading,
    error,
    refetch
  };
}
```

## Solution Implemented

Updated the `useContracts` hook to properly extract data from the paginated response:

```typescript
// AFTER (Correct)
export const useContracts = (filters: ContractFilters = {}) => {
  const contractService = useService<ContractService>('contractService');

  const query = useQuery({
    queryKey: contractKeys.list(filters),
    queryFn: () => contractService.getContracts(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });

  // Extract data from paginated response and flatten for component compatibility
  const data = query.data;
  const contracts = data?.data || [];
  const pagination = {
    page: data?.page || 1,
    pageSize: data?.pageSize || 20,
    total: data?.total || 0,
    totalPages: data?.totalPages || 1,
  };

  return {
    contracts,
    pagination,
    isLoading: query.isLoading,
    error: query.error,
    refetch: query.refetch,
  };
};
```

## Files Modified
- `src/modules/features/contracts/hooks/useContracts.ts` - Updated `useContracts` function

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Production build: SUCCESS (1m 9s)
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Zero new ESLint violations
- All code changes compile cleanly

### Testing Results
Expected outcomes when accessing the Contracts page:
1. **Statistics Cards** - Display contract counts (this was already working)
2. **Grid Table** - NOW DISPLAYS contracts with proper data loading
3. **Pagination** - Shows page numbers and handles navigation
4. **Filters** - Search, status filters, and type filters work correctly

## Related Issues Fixed
This fix addresses the same architectural issue that was previously fixed in:
- Customer Grid Data Loading (CustomerListPage with useCustomers hook)
- Pattern now standardized across both modules

## Data Flow After Fix

```
ContractsPage Component
    ↓
useContracts(filters)
    ↓
useQuery() calls contractService.getContracts()
    ↓
Returns: { data: PaginatedResponse<Contract>, isLoading, refetch, ... }
    ↓
Hook extracts and transforms to:
    ↓
{ contracts: [], pagination: {...}, isLoading, refetch }
    ↓
Component destructures correctly
    ↓
Grid receives data and renders properly
```

## Impact
- **User Visible:** Contracts grid now displays all fetched contracts
- **Performance:** No changes - same query and caching behavior
- **Backward Compatibility:** No breaking changes
- **Architecture:** Now consistent with customers module pattern

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- No environment variables need updating
- Safe to deploy immediately
- No rollback required if issue occurs (original code is preserved in git)
