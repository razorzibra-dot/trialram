## Staging Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Pull latest code from main branch
- [ ] Verify node_modules installed: `npm install`
- [ ] Clear any old build artifacts: `rm -r dist/`
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify build output (should complete in ~1m 38s)

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy `dist/` folder to staging environment
- [ ] Verify application loads without errors
- [ ] Check browser console (should show no errors)

### Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] ‚úÖ Navigate to Customer module ‚Üí create customer
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify success notification appears
- [ ] ‚úÖ Try to create invalid entry (e.g., missing required field)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify error notification appears
- [ ] ‚úÖ Switch between light/dark theme
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify notifications adapt to theme
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test in at least 2 different browsers
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test on mobile device/browser
- [ ] ‚úÖ Check that no console errors appear

### Staging Sign-Off
- [ ] All smoke tests passed
- [ ] No console errors detected
- [ ] Notifications working correctly
- [ ] Theme switching working
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING STAGING TEST**

---

## Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Verify staging tests all passed
- [ ] Plan deployment window (low-traffic time preferred)
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan (git commit ready)
- [ ] Notify team of deployment timing
- [ ] Backup current production build

### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. [ ] Clean build: `rm -r dist/`
4. [ ] Build for production: `npm run build`
5. [ ] Verify build output:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Should see: "built in ~1m 38s"
   ‚úÖ Should see: 0 TypeScript errors
   ‚úÖ Should see: Output in dist/ folder
   ```
6. [ ] Deploy dist/ to production server
7. [ ] Verify application loads
8. [ ] Test in browser console (should be clean)

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Check browser console (should be clean)
- [ ] Navigate to main dashboard
- [ ] Try create/update operation
- [ ] Verify success notification appears
- [ ] Trigger error scenario
- [ ] Verify error notification appears
- [ ] Test multiple notifications rapidly
- [ ] Verify notifications stack properly
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation)

**If All Tests Pass**:
- ‚úÖ **Deployment successful**
- ‚úÖ **Monitor for 24 hours**
- ‚úÖ **Check error logs regularly**

**If Issues Occur**:
- ‚ùå Execute rollback (see Rollback section below)
- ‚ùå Investigate in staging
- ‚ùå Report issue to development team

---

## 24-Hour Monitoring

### Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Hour 1: Check application is responsive
- [ ] Hour 1: Verify no spike in error logs
- [ ] Hour 4: Test all major workflows
- [ ] Hour 8: Monitor user feedback channels
- [ ] Hour 24: Final verification

### What to Look For
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: Normal operation, no toast-related errors
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: Notifications appear correctly
- ‚úÖ **Expected**: No increase in error logs
- ‚ùå **Unexpected**: Any console errors related to notifications
- ‚ùå **Unexpected**: Notifications not appearing
- ‚ùå **Unexpected**: Notifications appearing incorrectly

### Escalation Triggers
If any of these occur, contact development team immediately:
- Console showing notification-related errors
- Notifications not displaying
- Application crashing
- Performance degradation

---

## Rollback Plan (Emergency Only)

### When to Rollback
- If critical functionality broken
- If error rate increased significantly
- If data loss detected
- If security issue discovered

### Rollback Steps
```bash
# 1. Stop current application
systemctl stop app-service  # or your stop command

# 2. Go to previous version
git checkout HEAD~1

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build
npm run build

# 5. Deploy previous version
# Copy dist/ to deployment location

# 6. Restart application
systemctl start app-service  # or your start command

# 7. Verify it works
# Test in browser, check console
```

### Rollback Time Estimate: **10-15 minutes**

## Build Command Reference

```bash
# Clean install (if needed)
npm ci

# Development build (fast, with source maps)
npm run dev

# Production build (optimized, minified)
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Environment Variables

**No changes needed!** The migration doesn't require any new environment variables.

Optional: Add to `.env` for customization
```env
# Notification placement (default: topRight)
VITE_NOTIFICATION_PLACEMENT=topRight

# Quick message duration (default: 3 seconds)
VITE_MESSAGE_DURATION=3

# Persistent notification duration (default: 4.5 seconds)
VITE_NOTIFICATION_DURATION=4.5
```

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Application Health
```bash
# Check if service is running
systemctl status app-service

# View application logs
journalctl -u app-service -f

# Check error logs (if applicable)
tail -f /var/log/app/error.log
```

### Verify Build Quality
```bash
# Check file size
du -sh dist/

# List main bundle files
ls -lh dist/assets/ | head -20
```
