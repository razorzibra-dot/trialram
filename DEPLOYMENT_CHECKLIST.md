## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (Do These First!)

#### 1. Site Loads
```
Visit: https://your-domain.com/app
Expected: Login page appears ‚úÖ
```
- [ ] Site loads without errors

```
- [ ] All 4 routing messages appear
- [ ] No error messages
- [ ] No "undefined" references

### Functional Tests (These Verify the Fix)

## üö® Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Rollback Steps
```bash
# 1. Identify the issue
# Check browser console for error messages

# 2. Review the change
git diff HEAD~1 src/services/api/apiServiceFactory.ts

# 3. Revert if needed
git revert HEAD

# 4. Rebuild
npm run build

# 5. Deploy reverted version
cp -r dist/* /var/www/crm/
```

- [ ] Data not loading when it was before
- [ ] Customers see errors after 1 hour
- [ ] Database connection fails completely
- [ ] Multi-tenant data is mixing (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Performance is significantly degraded

### Fallback: Use Mock Mode
```env
# Temporarily set in .env
VITE_API_MODE=mock
```
- [ ] Application continues to work with mock data
- [ ] Buying time to investigate real issue
- [ ] Users can continue with demo data
- [ ] No data loss
