## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Communication
```bash
[ ] Notify stakeholders (2 hours before)

[ ] Prepare incident war room (Slack channel/meeting)
[ ] Have rollback team on standby
[ ] Ensure monitoring dashboard open
```

### Phase 2: Deploy to Staging (If Not Already Done)
```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -la dist/

# Deploy to staging endpoint
[ ] Run staging deployment script
[ ] Verify staging is responsive
```

### Phase 3: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deployment options (choose one):

# Option A: Using CI/CD pipeline
[ ] Trigger production deployment pipeline
[ ] Monitor deployment logs
[ ] Wait for health checks to pass

# Option B: Manual deployment
[ ] Upload dist/ folder to CDN/hosting
[ ] Update DNS if needed
[ ] Clear CDN cache
[ ] Verify files uploaded correctly

# Option C: Blue-Green Deployment
[ ] Deploy to green environment
[ ] Route 10% traffic to green
[ ] Monitor for errors (5 min)
[ ] Route 50% traffic to green
[ ] Monitor for errors (10 min)
[ ] Route 100% traffic to green
[ ] Keep blue environment as rollback
```

### Phase 4: Run Database Migrations
```bash
[ ] Backup production database (confirmed)
[ ] Run migrations: supabase db push --password $DB_PASSWORD
[ ] Verify migrations completed
[ ] Run post-migration verification queries
```

### Phase 5: Immediate Post-Deployment Checks
- [ ] **Application loads**: https://production.url loads without errors
- [ ] **No console errors**: Check browser DevTools console
