# Phase 3: Service Contract Management - Complete Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on comprehensive Service Contract Management with emphasis on detailed views, renewals, and cancellations. This phase extends the basic service contract generation from Phase 2 to provide full lifecycle management capabilities.

## Current Status
✅ **Phase 2 Complete** - Service contracts are auto-generated from product sales
✅ **Service Layer** - ServiceContractService has core methods (renew, cancel, update)
✅ **List View** - ServiceContractsPage displays contracts with filtering and pagination
✅ **Detail View** - ServiceContractDetailPage exists but needs integration

## Phase 3 Objectives

  - All modifications tracked chronologically
  - Renewal events showing new contract number
  - Cancellation events with reason
  - Payment milestones

## Data Model Enhancements

### ServiceContract Enhancement
```typescript
interface ServiceContractActivity {
  id: string;
  contract_id: string;
  type: 'created' | 'renewed' | 'modified' | 'cancelled' | 'payment' | 'note';
  description: string;
  reason?: string; // for cancellations
  old_values?: Record<string, unknown>;
  new_values?: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp: string;
  user_id: string;
  user_name: string;
}

interface ServiceContractVersion {
  id: string;
  contract_id: string;
  version: number;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string;
  status: 'renewed' | 'current';
  contract_number: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Lazy load activity timeline on detail page
- [ ] Cache contract data with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Paginate timeline activities
- [ ] Optimize contract list queries
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All components created and tested
- [ ] Service layer methods implemented
- [ ] Types and interfaces updated
- [ ] Routes configured
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Notifications configured
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- All service contract data currently uses mock data from serviceContractService
- Production implementation will use Supabase with real database
- Email notifications will require backend integration
- PDF generation requires template system (Phase 4 or later)
- Version tracking will require Supabase audit tables
