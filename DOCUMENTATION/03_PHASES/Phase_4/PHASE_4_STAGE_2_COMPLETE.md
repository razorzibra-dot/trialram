## Service Factory Updates

**Location**: `src/services/serviceFactory.ts`

### New Methods Added:
1. **`getProductSaleService()`** - Routes to Supabase or mock based on mode
2. **`getCustomerService()`** - Routes to Supabase or mock based on mode
3. **Enhanced `getService(serviceName)`** - Now handles 'productsale' and 'customer'

### New Convenience Exports:
1. **`productSaleService`** - Proxy object with all methods
2. **`customerService`** - Proxy object with all methods

### Seamless Mode Switching:
```typescript
// Current: VITE_API_MODE=supabase (in .env)
// Can be switched to 'mock' or 'real' instantly without code changes

// All components use:
import { productSaleService, customerService } from '@/services/serviceFactory';

// Service factory handles routing automatically
productSaleService.getProductSales(); // Uses Supabase
customerService.getCustomers();      // Uses Supabase
```

---

## Integration Pattern

### Architecture Layer Flow:
```
React Component
      ↓
useAuth() for tenantId
      ↓
Import from serviceFactory
      ↓
serviceFactory routes based on VITE_API_MODE
      ↓
Supabase Service (selected)
      ↓
Query Builders (add tenant filter)
      ↓
Supabase Client (with JWT auth)
      ↓
PostgreSQL Database
      ↓
Response mapping to TS interfaces
```

### Security Pattern:
```
Every Product Sale Query:
  .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)  ← Tenant isolation

Every Customer Query:
  .eq('tenant_id', tenantId)  ← Tenant isolation

Database RLS Policies:
  - Enforce JWT authentication
  - Enforce tenant_id matching
  - Double-layer security
```

---

## Supabase Index Export Updates

**Location**: `src/services/supabase/index.ts`

Added exports:
```typescript
export { supabaseServiceContractService } from './serviceContractService';
export { supabaseProductSaleService } from './productSaleService';
export { supabaseCustomerService } from './customerService';
```

Provides centralized access point for all Supabase services.

---

## Key Implementation Details

### Multi-Tenant Safety:
✅ Every query includes `addTenantFilter(query, tenantId)`  
✅ Prevents cross-tenant data leakage  
✅ Combined with database RLS for defense-in-depth

### Error Handling:
✅ All errors passed through `handleSupabaseError()`  
✅ User-friendly messages ("Failed to fetch product sales")  
✅ Logs detailed errors to console for debugging

### Query Optimization:
✅ Pagination implemented for large datasets  
✅ Efficient filtering at database level  
✅ Proper indexing via query builders

### Analytics Aggregation:
✅ Monthly sales trends calculation  
✅ Top products/customers ranking  
✅ Status distribution statistics  
✅ Warranty expiry detection

### File Management:
✅ Attachment upload to Supabase storage  
✅ Public URL generation  
✅ File metadata tracking

## Data Structure Alignment

### Product Sales Table Schema:
```sql
product_sales (
  id, customer_id, customer_name,
  product_id, product_name,
  units, cost_per_unit, total_cost,
  delivery_date, warranty_expiry,
  status, notes, attachments,
  service_contract_id,
  tenant_id, created_at, updated_at, created_by
)
```

### Customers Table Schema:
```sql
customers (
  id, company_name, contact_name,
  email, phone, address, city, country,
  industry, size, status, notes,
  assigned_to, tenant_id,
  created_at, updated_at
)

customer_tags (
  id, name, color,
  tenant_id, created_at
)
```
