## Migration Guide for Developers

### Converting a Page to EnterpriseLayout

  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <h1>My Page</h1>
      {/* content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { EnterpriseLayout } from '@/components/layout/EnterpriseLayout';
import { PageHeader, StatCard } from '@/components/common';
import { Row, Col, Button } from 'antd';
import { PlusOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

export const MyPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <EnterpriseLayout>
      <PageHeader
        title="My Page"
        description="Page description"
        breadcrumb={{
          items: [
            { title: 'Home', path: '/tenant/dashboard' },
            { title: 'My Page' }
          ]
        }}
        extra={
          <Button type="primary" icon={<PlusOutlined />}>
            New Item
          </Button>
        }
      />

      <div style={{ padding: 24 }}>
        {/* content */}
      </div>
    </EnterpriseLayout>
  );
};
