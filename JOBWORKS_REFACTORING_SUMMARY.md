# JobWorks Module Refactoring Summary

## 🎯 Objective
Refactor the JobWorks module from old grid control to unified enterprise-grade architecture with side drawer-based CRUD operations, matching the Customers module pattern.

- ✅ Currency formatting for costs
- ✅ Overdue date highlighting

**Architecture:**

## ✨ Architecture Alignment

### 3-Layer Pattern Implementation
```
Service Layer (jobWorksService.ts)
    ↓
Hook Layer (useJobWorks.ts)
    ↓
Component Layer (JobWorksPage.tsx + Drawer Components)
```

### Service Layer (jobWorksService.ts)
- ✅ JobWork interface with all fields
- ✅ JobWorksFilters for flexible filtering
- ✅ CreateJobWorkData for form submission
- ✅ Methods: getJobWorks, getJobWork, createJobWork, updateJobWork, deleteJobWork, updateJobWorkStatus, getJobWorkStats
- ✅ Error handling via handleError
- ✅ Mock data for development

### Hook Layer (useJobWorks.ts)
- ✅ Query keys structure for React Query
- ✅ useJobWorks: Fetch with pagination and filters
- ✅ useJobWork: Fetch single item
- ✅ useJobWorkStats: Fetch statistics
- ✅ useCreateJobWork: Create with success/error handling
- ✅ useUpdateJobWork: Update with invalidation
- ✅ useDeleteJobWork: Delete with toast notifications
- ✅ Proper cache invalidation on mutations

### Component Layer
- ✅ JobWorksPage: Main list with Ant Design Table
- ✅ JobWorksDetailPanel: Read-only details drawer
- ✅ JobWorksFormPanel: Create/Edit form drawer
- ✅ Proper state management with drawer modes
- ✅ Permission-based UI rendering

## 📊 Grid Control Features

### Table Columns (Minimal & Focused)
1. **Job Work** - Title + Customer name (sub-text)
2. **Status** - Color-coded tag (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
3. **Priority** - Color-coded tag (low, medium, high, urgent)
4. **Assigned To** - User name or "Unassigned"
5. **Due Date** - Formatted date with overdue highlighting
6. **Cost** - Currency formatted amount
7. **Actions** - View, Edit, Delete with permissions

### Search & Filter
- ✅ Search by job work title or customer name
- ✅ Input validation with Ant Design components
- ✅ Real-time filter updates
- ✅ Pagination support (page, pageSize)

### Styling & UX
- ✅ Ant Design components (Button, Tag, Popconfirm, Space)
- ✅ Consistent color scheme (status and priority colors)
- ✅ Responsive table layout
- ✅ Loading states and empty states
- ✅ Success/Error message notifications

## 🔗 Module Registration

**Status:** ✅ Already registered in `src/modules/bootstrap.ts`
```typescript
const { jobWorksModule } = await import('./features/jobworks');
registerModule(jobWorksModule);
```

## 📋 Alignment Checklist
