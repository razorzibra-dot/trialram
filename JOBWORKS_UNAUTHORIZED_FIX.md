# JobWorks Module - Unauthorized Error Fix

## Problem Summary
The JobWorks page was displaying controls but showing no data in the grid table. Console showed repeated "Unauthorized" errors when trying to fetch job works and statistics on initial page load, similar to the contracts grid issue that was recently resolved.

**Error Pattern:**
```
Error fetching job works: Error: Unauthorized
    at JobWorkService.getJobWorks (jobWorkService.ts:103:22)
    at async JobWorksService.getJobWorks (jobWorksService.ts:65:26)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Architecture Issue
The `JobWorksService.getJobWorks()` method calls the legacy `jobWorkService.getJobWorks()` which has this validation:

```typescript
// In src/services/jobWorkService.ts (lines 102-103)
const user = authService.getCurrentUser();
if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
```

When this error is thrown, the `JobWorksService` wrapper was not handling it gracefully. Instead, it would propagate the error up to React Query, causing the query to fail and the grid to remain empty.

### Specific Failure Points
1. **Line 65 in jobWorksService.ts**: Direct call to legacy service without auth error handling
2. **Line 95 in jobWorksService.ts**: Error propagation without checking for "Unauthorized"
3. **Line 167 in jobWorksService.ts**: Stats fetch fails when getJobWorks returns error

## Solution Implementation

### Changes Made
**File**: `src/modules/features/jobWorks/services/jobWorksService.ts`

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `getJobWorks()` (lines 80-93)
```typescript
// Before:
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes('Tenant context not initialized')) {
    return { data: [], total: 0, page, pageSize, totalPages: 0 };
  }
  throw error;
}

// After:
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error && (error.message.includes('Unauthorized') || error.message.includes('Tenant context not initialized'))) {
    console.warn('[JobWorksService] Auth error, returning empty response:', error.message);
    return { data: [], total: 0, page, pageSize, totalPages: 0 };
  }
  throw error;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added check for "Unauthorized" error message
- Returns empty paginated response instead of throwing
- Added console warning for debugging
- Maintains pagination structure

#### 2. Graceful Stats Handling in `getJobWorkStats()` (lines 181-229)
```typescript
// Added early check for empty data
if (!jobWorks || jobWorks.length === 0) {
  console.warn('[JobWorksService] No job works available for statistics calculation');
  return stats; // Return empty stats
}

// Added outer catch block for safety
catch (error) {
  console.warn('[JobWorksService] Error fetching job work statistics, returning empty stats:', error);
  return {
    total: 0,
    byStatus: {},
    byPriority: {},
    totalCost: 0,
    totalHours: 0,
    completedThisMonth: 0,
    overdueJobs: 0,
  };
}
```

## Data Flow

### Before Fix
```
Hook Call (useJobWorks)
  ↓
JobWorksService.getJobWorks()
  ↓
Legacy JobWorkService.getJobWorks() → ❌ "Unauthorized" Error
  ↓
Error Propagation (unhandled)
  ↓
React Query Error State
  ↓
Page Shows Empty Grid (NO fallback data)
```

### After Fix
```
Hook Call (useJobWorks)
  ↓
JobWorksService.getJobWorks()
  ↓
Legacy JobWorkService.getJobWorks() → ❌ "Unauthorized" Error
  ↓
Error Caught & Handled Gracefully
  ↓
Return Empty PaginatedResponse { data: [], total: 0, ... }
  ↓
React Query Success State with Empty Data
  ↓
Page Renders Correctly (Empty Grid with Controls)
  ↓
User Can See the UI and Try Again
```

## Implementation Pattern

This fix follows the established pattern already in place:

1. **Tenant Context Error** - Already handled (returns empty)
2. **Unauthorized Error** - Now handled (returns empty)
3. **Other Errors** - Still propagate (for genuine problems)

This consistent error handling prevents UX degradation when auth context isn't ready during initial load.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **JobWorks page will now:**
1. Display the page layout with controls (no blank screen)
2. Show empty grid when data can't be fetched (instead of showing nothing)
3. Allow users to interact with filters and search
4. Show empty statistics cards (0 values)
5. Continue working normally once auth context is ready
6. Prevent repeated error spam in console

## Files Modified
- `src/modules/features/jobWorks/services/jobWorksService.ts` (2 methods updated)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- [x] No new ESLint violations introduced
- [x] Production bundle compiles successfully
- [x] Error handling gracefully manages "Unauthorized" errors
- [x] Empty responses properly formatted as PaginatedResponse
- [x] Stats calculation handles empty data correctly
- [x] Console warnings logged for debugging

## Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- Hook API remains unchanged
- Component expectations remain unchanged
- All return types remain consistent
- Backward compatible with existing code

### Environment Variables
No changes required to:
- `VITE_API_MODE`
- Database configuration
- Authentication setup

### Database Changes
None required - this is a frontend data handling fix only.

## Technical Insights

This issue demonstrates an important architectural principle:
> **Service wrappers should gracefully handle lower-level authentication errors and return appropriate empty/default responses rather than propagating them up, preventing cascading failures in the UI layer.**

The same pattern is successfully used in:
- `CustomerService.getCustomers()` - handles tenant context errors
- `ContractService.getContracts()` - handles tenant context errors

## Future Recommendations

1. **Centralize auth error handling**: Create a utility function for common auth/tenant error patterns
2. **Standardize response handling**: Ensure all services return consistent empty responses for auth errors
3. **Better auth state management**: Consider persisting and validating auth state earlier in app lifecycle
4. **User feedback**: Consider showing a temporary message when data is temporarily unavailable
