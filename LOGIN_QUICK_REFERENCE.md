## 💡 Why These Changes Work

### Toast Error Fix
- ❌ **OLD**: `toast()` → undefined function
- ✅ **NEW**: `notificationService` → proper implementation
- **Why**: Service-based API works in contexts, hooks don't

### Button Visibility
- ❌ **OLD**: Implicit colors → visibility issues
- ✅ **NEW**: `bg-blue-600 text-white` → crystal clear
- **Why**: Explicit, high-contrast colors are always visible

### Professional Look
- ❌ **OLD**: Basic styling → plain appearance
- ✅ **NEW**: Shadows, gradients, transitions → premium feel
- **Why**: Modern UI requires visual polish

## 📞 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Button text still not visible | Clear browser cache, hard refresh |
| Login still shows toast error | Make sure build completed (`npm run build`) |
| Notification not appearing | Check `notificationService` is imported |
| Demo buttons don't work | Verify onClick handlers are firing |
| Styling looks wrong | Check Tailwind CSS is compiling |
