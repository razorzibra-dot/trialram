# Logout Redirect Fix - 60-Second Verification ⚡

## Prerequisites
- Application running with `npm run dev`
- Developer Console open (F12)
- Test user credentials available

## 60-Second Test

### Step 1: Login (20 seconds)
```
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/login
2. Enter test@example.com / password
3. Click Login
4. Wait for dashboard to load
5. ✓ Should see dashboard
```

### Step 2: Logout (20 seconds)
```
1. Click Logout button (top right)
2. Watch browser console for logs:
   [AuthContext] Starting logout sequence...
   [AuthContext] Session monitoring stopped
   [AuthContext] Session data cleared from storage
   [AuthContext] Auth state cleared (isLoading=true)
   [AuthContext] State update delay completed
   [AuthContext] Auth state updated (isLoading=false)
   [AuthContext] Navigating to login page
3. ✓ Should be redirected to /login
4. ✓ Should see login form (not dashboard)
```

### Step 3: Verify State (20 seconds)
```
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab
2. Check localStorage:
   ✓ crm_auth_token should be EMPTY
   ✓ crm_user should be EMPTY
3. Manually refresh page (Ctrl+R)
4. ✓ Should still see login form
5. ✓ NOT redirected to dashboard
```

## Expected Console Output

```
[AuthContext] Starting logout sequence...
[AuthContext] Session monitoring stopped
[AuthContext] Session data cleared from storage
[AuthContext] Backend logout completed
[AuthContext] Tenant context cleared
[AuthContext] Auth state cleared (isLoading=true)
[AuthContext] State update delay completed
Logged out
You have been successfully logged out.
[AuthContext] Auth state updated (isLoading=false)
[AuthContext] Navigating to login page
[LoginPage] User already authenticated, redirecting to: /tenant/dashboard
[ProtectedRoute] Auth loading, showing skeleton
[ProtectedRoute] Auth state settled
```

## Success Criteria ✓

After logout, you should see:

| Item | Expected | Actual |
|------|----------|--------|
| Redirected to login page | ✓ Yes | ☐ |
| Login form displays | ✓ Yes | ☐ |
| Session data cleared | ✓ Yes | ☐ |
| After refresh, still login | ✓ Yes | ☐ |
| No redirect to dashboard | ✓ Yes | ☐ |
| Console logs show sequence | ✓ Yes | ☐ |

## Failure Diagnosis

### Problem: Redirected back to dashboard
**Check**:
- [ ] Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- [ ] Dev server restarted (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] localStorage actually cleared (DevTools → Application)
- [ ] Console shows all expected logs

### Problem: Shows "Loading..." indefinitely
**Check**:
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] `isLoading` state changes properly
- [ ] Network requests complete

### Problem: Can access protected routes after logout
**Check**:
- [ ] localStorage is actually cleared
- [ ] Browser not caching responses
- [ ] Backend logout endpoint works

## Advanced: Browser DevTools Check

### Console Logs
```javascript
// Should see this sequence:
[AuthContext] Starting logout sequence...
[AuthContext] Session monitoring stopped
[AuthContext] Session data cleared from storage
[AuthContext] Backend logout completed
[AuthContext] Tenant context cleared
[AuthContext] Auth state cleared (isLoading=true)
[AuthContext] State update delay completed
[AuthContext] Auth state updated (isLoading=false)
[AuthContext] Navigating to login page
[LoginPage] User already authenticated, redirecting to: /tenant/dashboard
[ProtectedRoute] Auth loading, showing skeleton
[ProtectedRoute] Auth state settled
```

### Application Storage
```
Before Logout:
- localStorage.crm_auth_token: "eyJhbGc..."
- localStorage.crm_user: "{"id":"user123"...}"

After Logout:
- localStorage.crm_auth_token: (empty)
- localStorage.crm_user: (empty)
- sessionStorage: (cleared)
```

### Network Tab
```
POST /api/auth/logout
Status: 200 OK
Response: { success: true }
```
