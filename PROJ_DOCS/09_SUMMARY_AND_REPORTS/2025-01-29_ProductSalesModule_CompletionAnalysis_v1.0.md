## Comparison with Similar Modules

### Tickets Module (Reference)

```
Product Sales vs. Tickets Module:
                       Product Sales  Tickets
Store                   0%            ‚úÖ 100%
Hooks                   10%           ‚úÖ 100%
Components              80%           ‚úÖ 100%
Workflows               10%           ‚úÖ 80%
Testing                 5%            ‚úÖ 60%
Documentation           95%           ‚úÖ 90%
Integration             60%           ‚úÖ 75%
```

**Difference**: Product Sales lacks hooks and store, has less workflow automation

### Contracts Module (Reference)

```

                       Product Sales  Contracts
Store                   0%            ‚úÖ 100%
Hooks                   10%           ‚úÖ 100%
Components              80%           ‚úÖ 100%
Workflows               10%           ‚úÖ 90%
Testing                 5%            ‚úÖ 70%
Documentation           95%           ‚úÖ 85%
```
