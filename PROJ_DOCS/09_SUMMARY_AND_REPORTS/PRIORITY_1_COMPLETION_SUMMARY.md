## 📝 Next Steps (Priority 2-3)

**Optional follow-up actions**:
- [ ] Priority 2: Clean up 5 root PROJ_DOCS summary files (archive/deprecate)
- [ ] Priority 2: Verify APP_DOCS archive coverage
- [ ] Priority 3: Create master index of all 115+ source files consolidated
- [ ] Priority 3: Create automated troubleshooting decision tree
- [ ] Priority 3: Verify MARK_FOR_DELETE files coverage

**Recommendation**: Priority 1 completion is sufficient for production use. Priority 2-3 can be addressed in a follow-up session if desired.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Structure vs. Discovery**: Content existed but wasn't discoverable
2. **Two-Level Architecture**: Need to bridge summary and detail layers
3. **Navigation Matters**: Users need clear paths, not just content existence
4. **Comprehensive Indexing**: Improves usability exponentially
