---

## PHASE 1: Critical Workflow Implementation (Days 1-3)

### Sprint 1: ConvertToContractModal Completion

#### Section 1.1: Setup & Structure
- [ ] **Open file**: `src/modules/features/sales/components/ConvertToContractModal.tsx`
- [ ] **Review current code**: Lines 1-60 (interface and imports)
- [ ] **Verify dependencies**:
  - [ ] `useService<SalesService>('salesService')` hook available
  - [ ] `useCreateContract()` from contracts module available
  - [ ] Form component from Ant Design imported
- [ ] **Check types**: 
  - [ ] `Deal` type imported correctly
  - [ ] `ContractFormData` type available
  - [ ] Error types defined
- [ ] **Create local branch**: `feature/convert-to-contract-modal`

#### Section 1.2: Deal Validation
- [ ] **Create validation method** in `SalesService` (if not exists):
  ```typescript
  validateDealForConversion(deal: Deal): ValidationResult {
    // Check: Deal is closed/won
    // Check: Deal has customer_id
    // Check: Deal has required fields
    // Check: Not already converted
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Add validation UI**: Show validation errors/warnings in modal

  - [ ] Lost deal fails validation ✓
  - [ ] Deal without customer fails ✓
  - [ ] Already-converted deal fails ✓

#### Section 1.3: Contract Pre-filling
- [ ] **Map deal fields to contract fields**:
  - [ ] `deal.name` → `contract.title`

- [ ] **Implement submit logic**:
  ```typescript
  const handleSubmit = async (values) => {
    1. Validate form data
    2. Call useCreateContract mutation
    3. On success: 
       - Update deal status to 'converted'
       - Show success message
       - Navigate to contract
       - Close modal
    4. On error:
       - Show error message
       - Preserve form data
       - Offer retry
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Error handling**:
