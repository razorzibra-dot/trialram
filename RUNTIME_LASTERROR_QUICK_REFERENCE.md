# Runtime.lastError Fix - Quick Reference

## Problem

```
Unchecked runtime.lastError: A listener indicated an asynchronous response 
by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

Appears randomly on many pages in browser console.

---

## Solution

✅ **FIXED** - Handler automatically suppresses extension-related warnings

---

## What Was Changed

### New File
```
src/utils/extensionErrorHandler.ts  (2.1 KB)
```

### Modified File
```
src/main.tsx  (+5 lines)
```

---

## How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: Message listener registered
2. **During Runtime**: All extension messages properly acknowledged
3. **Cleanup**: Proper teardown on page unload

---

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ SUCCESS (0 errors)
```

### Console Check
```javascript
if (window.chrome?.runtime?.onMessage) {
  console.log('✅ Handler active');
}
```
