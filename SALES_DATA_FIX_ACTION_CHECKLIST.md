# Sales Deal Data Retrieval - Action Checklist ✅

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Data Transformation Layer (Already Complete)
- The `mapSale()` function in `src/services/index.ts` now properly extracts:
  - `source` field
  - `campaign` field
  - `tags` array
  - `items` (products) with flexible format support
  - `customer_name` with fallback values

### ✅ Form Components (Just Completed)
- Added `Campaign` text input field to form
- Added `Tags` text input field (comma-separated) to form
- Form now populates these fields when editing deals
- Form submission properly converts comma-separated tags to array

### ✅ Grid Display (Just Completed)
- Added `Source` column to grid
- Added `Campaign` column to grid
- Added `Tags` column with badge display
- All columns now show the actual data from database

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Build ✅
```bash
npm run build
# Output should show: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Server
```bash
# Deploy the dist folder to your hosting
npm run build
# Then deploy dist/ folder to your server
```

### Step 3: Test in Browser

#### Test 1: Create New Deal
1. Open the Sales module
2. Click "Create Deal"
3. Fill in the form:
   - Deal Title: "Test Enterprise Deal"
   - Customer: Select any customer
   - Value: 50000
   - Stage: "Proposal"
   - Source: "Referral"
   - **Campaign: "Q4 2024 Enterprise"** (NEW)
   - **Tags: "enterprise, high-value, strategic"** (NEW)
4. Click "Create Deal"
5. Check database (Supabase Studio) - verify all fields are saved ✅

#### Test 2: Verify Grid Display
1. Back to Sales list
2. Scroll right to see new columns
3. **Verify you can see:**
   - ✅ "Source" column with value "referral"
   - ✅ "Campaign" column with value "Q4 2024 Enterprise"
   - ✅ "Tags" column with badges: "enterprise", "high-value", "strategic"

#### Test 3: Edit Deal
1. Click "Edit" on the newly created deal
2. **Verify the form shows:**
   - ✅ Campaign field filled with "Q4 2024 Enterprise"
   - ✅ Tags field filled with "enterprise, high-value, strategic"
   - ✅ Source field shows "Referral"
3. Modify tags to: "enterprise, strategic, renewal"
4. Update the deal
5. **Verify in grid:**
   - ✅ Tags now show: "enterprise", "strategic", "renewal"

#### Test 4: Existing Deals (If Any)
1. Click "Edit" on any existing deal
2. **Verify the form shows:**
   - ✅ Campaign field populated (if data exists)
   - ✅ Tags field populated as comma-separated string (if data exists)
3. **Verify in grid:**
   - ✅ All deals show source, campaign, tags if they have data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Empty Fields After Deploy
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
2. Hard reload: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: Form Doesn't Show Campaign/Tags
**Solution:**
1. Check that `src/modules/features/sales/components/SalesDealFormPanel.tsx` has the new fields (lines 586-598)
2. Rebuild and redeploy: `npm run build`

### Issue: Grid Doesn't Show New Columns
**Solution:**
1. Check that `src/modules/features/sales/components/SalesList.tsx` has new column definitions (lines 222-256)
2. Hard reload browser page
3. Check grid is scrollable to the right to see new columns

### Issue: Tags Showing as String Instead of Array
**Solution:**
1. Tags are stored as array in database but shown as comma-separated string in form
2. This is correct behavior - form converts between string and array formats
3. Grid displays them as individual badges

## Database Verification

To verify data is saved correctly in Supabase:

```sql
-- View sales with new fields
SELECT id, title, customer_id, source, campaign, tags, value, stage 
FROM sales 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- View specific deal
SELECT * FROM sales 
WHERE id = 'your-deal-id';
```
