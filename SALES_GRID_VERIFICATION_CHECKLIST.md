## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Columns Still Showing Empty
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh page: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
3. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
4. Verify `.env` file has `VITE_API_MODE=supabase` or `mock`

### Issue: Deal Title Shows Empty
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify deal data exists in Supabase
3. Run SQL in Supabase console:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, assigned_to_name, expected_close_date 
   FROM sales 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
4. If data exists in DB but not in grid, restart dev server

### Issue: Product Column Shows "-" 
**Possible Reasons:**
- Deal has no products - expected behavior
- Products not loaded with deal - check data structure
- Database schema issue - verify items/products table

### Issue: Owner Column Shows "Unassigned"
**Possible Reasons:**
- Deal has no assigned user - expected
- Assigned user deleted - need to reassign
- Data not synced - try refreshing page

---

## Database Verification SQL

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check if deals have data
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  customer_id,
  assigned_to_name,
  expected_close_date,
  source,
  campaign,
  tags,
  value
FROM sales
LIMIT 10;

-- Check if products/items exist for deals
SELECT 
  sale_id,
  product_name,
  quantity,
  unit_price
FROM sale_items
LIMIT 10;

-- Check assigned users
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  assigned_to_name,
  assigned_to
FROM sales
WHERE assigned_to_name IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

## Browser DevTools Debug

Press **F12** to open DevTools:

1. **Check Console Tab:**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Look for warnings about data
   - No errors = ✅

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Look for failed API calls (red)
   - Check sales API response size
   - Should see `/sales` endpoint loaded

3. **Check Application Tab:**
   - Verify localStorage has auth token
   - Check cookies for session

---

## Success Indicators ✅

You'll know the fix is working when:

1. ✅ Grid loads without JavaScript errors
2. ✅ Deal Title column shows actual deal names
3. ✅ Owner column shows assigned user names
4. ✅ Expected Close shows dates (or "N/A")
5. ✅ Product column shows first product name

## Performance Notes

- Grid loads: ~1-2 seconds
- Renders 10-20 rows by default
- Pagination working if more than 20 deals
- No lag when scrolling
- Action dropdown opens instantly

---

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If issues occur, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout HEAD -- src/modules/features/sales/components/SalesList.tsx

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Clear cache and refresh browser
```

---

## Support Notes

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify the database** has deal data
3. **Check user permissions** for edit/delete operations
4. **Review the modification** in SalesList.tsx renders
5. **Ensure proper caching** is cleared

The fix is minimal and focused on parameter signature - very low risk of breaking anything else.

## Next Steps

After verification is complete:

1. Test with your actual data set
2. Verify performance with large datasets
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Consider column customization feature
5. Plan for future enhancements (inline editing, etc.)
