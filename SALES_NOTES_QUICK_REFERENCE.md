# Sales Notes Field Fix - Quick Reference

## Problem
Notes field was showing description content instead of notes content.

## Root Cause
`src/services/index.ts` line 205 had incorrect mapping:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
notes: s.description || s.notes || '',
```

## Solution
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
notes: s.notes || '',
```
