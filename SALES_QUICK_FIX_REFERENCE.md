# Sales Create/Update Fix - Quick Reference 🚀

## Two Issues Fixed ✅

### 1️⃣ Notification Error: `notificationService.notify is not a function`
**File**: `src/services/notificationService.ts`  
**Lines**: 357-396  
**What was wrong**: Method was missing  
**What was added**: 
```typescript
notify(options: {
  type: 'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error';
  message: string;
  description?: string;
  duration?: number;
  category?: string;
}): void
```
**Result**: ✅ Toast notifications now work during form submission

---

### 2️⃣ Form Data Structure Issue
**File**: `src/modules/features/sales/components/SalesDealFormPanel.tsx`  
**Lines**: 223-237  
**What was wrong**: Including extra `amount` field, missing `tags`  
**What was fixed**: Removed `amount`, added `tags: []`

**Before**:
```typescript
const dealData = {
  title, description, value, amount: value,  // ❌ Duplicate!
  stage, customer_id, assigned_to, 
  expected_close_date, probability, source,
  items
};
```

**After**:
```typescript
const dealData = {
  title, description, value,  // ✅ Single value field
  stage, customer_id, assigned_to,
  expected_close_date, probability, source,
  tags: [],  // ✅ Added
  items
};
```

**Result**: ✅ Form data now matches service interface exactly
