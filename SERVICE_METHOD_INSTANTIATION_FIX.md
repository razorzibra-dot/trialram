# Service Method Instantiation Issue - Root Cause Analysis and Fix

## Problem Summary
The `getCustomerStats` method is defined in the `CustomerService` class but doesn't appear on instances created by the ServiceContainer.

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: `hasGetCustomerStats: 'undefined'`
- Only 12 methods present instead of expected 15
- Missing methods: `importCustomers`, `searchCustomers`, `getCustomerStats`

## Root Cause
The issue is likely one of the following:

### 1. **Browser Cache Issue** (Most Likely)
The Vite dev server's module reload might not be properly recompiling/hotreloading the module with the new methods. The browser might be serving a cached version.

### 2. **Async Method Transpilation Issue**
All methods in CustomerService are `async`. There might be a build-time issue where these async methods aren't being properly added to the prototype.

### 3. **Class Property Descriptor Issue**
In rare cases, async methods defined after certain points in the class might not be enumerable/accessible depending on how TypeScript transpiles them.

## Immediate Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Hard Refresh + Clear Cache
1. In browser DevTools (F12), go to Application → Cache Storage
2. Clear all caches
3. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check console logs

### Solution 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Kill the dev server
# Clear node_modules cache
rm -r node_modules/.vite
# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Solution 3: Check Built File Explicitly

The enhanced logging added will show:
```javascript
[customerModule.initialize] Imported CustomerService
instanceMethodsCount: 15  // Should show all methods
instanceMethods: ['getCustomers', 'getCustomer', ..., 'getCustomerStats']
hasGetCustomerStatsOnInstance: true  // Should be true
```

If the module initialization shows the method on the instance, but the hook doesn't see it, then it's a cache or timing issue.

If the module initialization shows the method is missing even on the test instance, then it's a transpilation issue.

## Debug Logging Added

### In `/src/modules/features/customers/hooks/useCustomers.ts`:
```javascript
console.log('[useCustomerStats] Retrieved service:', {
  type: typeof service,
  constructor: (service as any)?.constructor?.name || 'unknown',
  hasGetCustomerStats: typeof (service as any)?.getCustomerStats,
  protoMethodsCount: protoMethods.length,
  protoMethods: protoMethods,  // ← Shows exact list of methods
  ownMethods: ownMethods,
  isGetCustomerStatsCallable: typeof (service as any)?.getCustomerStats === 'function'
});
```

### In `/src/modules/features/customers/index.ts`:
Module initialization now logs:
```javascript
{
  hasGetCustomerStats: true/false,
  protoMethodsCount: 15,
  prototypeMethods: [...],
  instanceMethodsCount: 15,
  instanceMethods: [...],  // ← Shows exact list of methods on instance
  hasGetCustomerStatsOnInstance: true/false
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Reload the development server:**
   - Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
   - Clear cache: `npm run clean` (if available) or `rm dist/`
   - Restart: `npm run dev`

2. **Open browser console (F12)**

3. **Look for these specific logs:**
   - `[customerModule.initialize]` - Shows methods on class and test instance
   - `[useCustomerStats] Retrieved service` - Shows methods on used instance

4. **Compare the results:**
   - If module init shows the method but hook doesn't: **CACHE ISSUE**
   - If module init doesn't show the method even on test instance: **TRANSPILATION ISSUE**

## If This Persists

If the method is missing even on the test instance during module initialization, we'll need to:

1. Check TypeScript compilation for async method handling
2. Verify the class is being exported correctly
3. Consider creating a non-async wrapper method as a workaround
4. Check if there's a build tool issue with method enumeration

## Quick Workaround (Temporary)

If this continues to be an issue, we can add a non-async wrapper method that delegates to the async one:

```typescript
// In CustomerService class
getCustomerStatsSync = () => this.getCustomerStats();

// In hook
const stats = await (service as any).getCustomerStatsSync();
```

But let's first determine the root cause using the enhanced logging.
