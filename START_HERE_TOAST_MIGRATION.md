## 🎓 The New API (30 seconds)

### Simple Messages (Auto-dismiss)
```typescript
import { notificationService } from '@/services';

notificationService.success('Data saved');    // Green, 3 sec
notificationService.error('Failed');           // Red, 3 sec
notificationService.warning('Careful');        // Orange, 3 sec
notificationService.info('Information');       // Blue, 3 sec
```

### Detailed Notifications (Manual dismiss)
```typescript
notificationService.successNotify('Title', 'Description');
notificationService.errorNotify('Error', 'What went wrong');
notificationService.warningNotify('Warning', 'Details');
notificationService.infoNotify('Info', 'Details');
```

**That's it!** No hooks, no imports from UI components, just use the service.

## ✅ What Changed (Developer Impact)

### Before (Old)
```typescript
import { useToast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';
const { toast } = useToast();
toast({ title: "Success", description: "Saved" });
```

```

**Impact**: Simpler, cleaner, more maintainable ✅
