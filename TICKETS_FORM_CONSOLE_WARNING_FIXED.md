# ✅ Tickets Form Panel - Console Warning FIXED

## Quick Reference

**Warning Fixed:**
```
⚠️ Warning: Instance created by `useForm` is not connected to any Form element. 
Forget to pass `form` prop?
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** `src/modules/features/tickets/components/TicketsFormPanel.tsx`
**TypeScript:** ✅ PASSED (exitCode 0)
**Console Warnings:** ✅ ALL FIXED

## What Was Wrong

The form instance wasn't being properly cleaned up when the drawer closed, causing React to think the form was orphaned.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Fix #1: Proper Form Lifecycle Cleanup
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    form.resetFields();  // ← KEY FIX: Clean up when drawer closes
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of initialization
}, [mode, ticket, isOpen, form]);
```

### Fix #2: Explicit Form Validation Before Submit
```typescript
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    form.validateFields()
      .then((values) => handleSubmit(values))
      .catch((err) => console.error('Validation failed:', err));
  }}
>
```

### Fix #3: Dedicated Drawer Close Handler
```typescript
const handleDrawerClose = useCallback(() => {
  form.resetFields();  // ← Clean form before closing
  onClose();
}, [form, onClose]);
```

### Fix #4: Better Error Handling & Notifications
- Removed duplicate notifications (hooks already provide them)
- Improved form submission flow
- Better structured code with comments
