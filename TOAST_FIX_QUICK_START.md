# üéØ Toast Notifications Fix - Quick Start

## What Was Wrong ‚ùå
Toast notifications weren't showing after sales operations (create/edit/delete).

## What's Fixed ‚úÖ
The `useToast()` hook was importing the wrong service:
- ‚ùå Was using: Database notification service  
- ‚úÖ Now using: UI notification service (Ant Design)

## File Changed
- **`src/hooks/use-toast.ts`** (2 small changes)

## Result
- ‚úÖ Create deal ‚Üí Shows success toast
- ‚úÖ Edit deal ‚Üí Shows success toast
- ‚úÖ Delete deal ‚Üí Shows success toast
- ‚úÖ Update stage ‚Üí Shows success toast
- ‚úÖ Errors ‚Üí Shows error toast

## Quick Test
1. Go to Sales page
2. Click "New Deal"
3. Fill in fields and click Create
4. **You should see a green success toast appear** ‚úÖ

If it works, you're done! üéâ

## Build Status
```
‚úÖ Compilation: Passed
‚úÖ Build Time: 43.93 seconds
‚úÖ TypeScript Errors: 0
‚úÖ Linting: No new issues
```

## Where to See It
Try these operations and look for the toast in the **top-right corner**:

| Operation | Toast |
|-----------|-------|
| Create | ‚úÖ Deal created successfully |
| Edit | ‚úÖ Deal updated successfully |
| Delete | ‚úÖ Deal deleted successfully |
| Stage Change | ‚úÖ Deal stage updated successfully |
| Error | ‚ùå Error message |

## For Developers

### Before (Broken ‚ùå)
```typescript
import { notificationService } from "@/services/notificationService"
// ^ This was the DATABASE notification service
```

### After (Fixed ‚úÖ)
```typescript
import { uiNotificationService } from "@/services/uiNotificationService"
// ^ This is the UI notification service (Ant Design)
```

### How to Use in Your Code
```typescript
// Option 1: useToast (now works!)
const { toast } = useToast();
toast({ title: 'Success', description: 'Done' });

// Option 2: useNotification (recommended)
const { success } = useNotification();
success('Done');

// Option 3: Direct service
import { uiNotificationService } from '@/services/uiNotificationService';
uiNotificationService.success('Done');
```

## Deployment
```bash
# Deploy as usual
npm run build
# Test in production
```
