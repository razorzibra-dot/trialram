## 🔄 Service Factory Integration

All components now use the unified factory approach:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - All components use factory
import { userService } from '@/services/serviceFactory';
import { rbacService } from '@/services/serviceFactory';

// Service routes automatically based on VITE_API_MODE
userService.getUsers()      // → Mock or Supabase
rbacService.getRoles()       // → Mock or Supabase
```

### Environment Variable Control

```bash
# Development with mock data
VITE_API_MODE=mock

# Production with Supabase
VITE_API_MODE=supabase

# No code changes needed - factory handles routing!
```

## 🔐 Security & Authorization

All pages properly implement permission checks:

```typescript
// Permission-based rendering
if (!hasPermission('manage_users')) {
  return <Alert message="Access Denied" />;
}

// Permission-based actions
{hasPermission('manage_users') && (
  <Button onClick={handleCreate}>Create User</Button>
)}
```

```
User clicks "Create User"
          ↓
UsersPage component opens modal
          ↓
User fills form and submits

Component calls: userService.createUser(data)
          ↓
Service Factory checks VITE_API_MODE
          ↓
Routes to Mock OR Supabase implementation
