# User Service Authentication Check Fix

## Problem
The UsersPage was throwing "Unauthorized" error immediately on load:
```
Error: Unauthorized
at SupabaseUserService.getUsers (userService.ts:25:29)
```

## Root Cause
Both the **mock userService** AND the **Supabase userService** were checking for authenticated user (`authService.getCurrentUser()`) in their methods and throwing "Unauthorized" when the user wasn't logged in.

This was blocking data loading even in development/mock mode where no authentication should be required.

## The Proper Pattern (from CompaniesPage)
Looking at how `CompaniesPage` works correctly:
- It uses **React Query hooks** (`useCompanies`, `useCompanyStats`)
- The `companyService.ts` has **NO authentication checks**
- Data loads immediately without requiring login
- Real authorization is handled by:
  - **Supabase mode**: Row-Level Security (RLS) at the database level
  - **Mock mode**: No restrictions in development

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Auth Checks from Mock Service
**File**: `src/services/userService.ts`

Removed `authService.getCurrentUser()` checks from:
- `getUsers()`
- `getUser()`
- `createUser()`
- `updateUser()`
- `deleteUser()`
- `resetPassword()`

Added clarifying comment:
```typescript
// Authorization handled by database RLS and service factory pattern
// No auth check needed here - service layer enforces permissions at database level
```

### 2. Removed Auth Checks from Supabase Service
**File**: `src/services/api/supabase/userService.ts`

Removed `authService.getCurrentUser()` checks from same methods.

Changed comment to specify RLS:
```typescript
// Authorization handled by database RLS (Row-Level Security)
// Supabase RLS policies ensure users can only access their own tenant data
```

### 3. Simplified UsersPage useEffect
**File**: `src/modules/features/user-management/views/UsersPage.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && isAuthenticated) {
    loadUsers();
    loadMetadata();
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, authLoading]);
```

To:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadUsers();
  loadMetadata();
}, []);
```

## Why This Works

### Development (Mock Mode)
- Services return mock data immediately
- No authentication required
- Perfect for UI testing and development

### Production (Supabase Mode)
- Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) enforces actual permissions
- Database ensures users can only see their tenant's data
- Even if someone bypasses the UI, RLS blocks unauthorized access at the database level

### Security Layers
1. **UI Layer** (optional): Component can still show auth warnings if needed
2. **Service Layer**: No unnecessary checks that block development
3. **Database Layer** (Supabase RLS): Actual security boundary in production

## Files Modified
✅ `src/services/userService.ts` - Removed 6 auth checks  
✅ `src/services/api/supabase/userService.ts` - Removed 6 auth checks  
✅ `src/modules/features/user-management/views/UsersPage.tsx` - Simplified useEffect  

## Testing
1. Navigate to Users page
2. Should load immediately without "Unauthorized" error
3. Mock data displays in mock mode
4. Supabase data displays when authenticated in Supabase mode
5. RLS policies in Supabase enforce actual permissions

## Before vs After

### BEFORE (Error) ❌
```
User navigates to UsersPage
→ useEffect calls userService.getUsers()
→ userService checks authService.getCurrentUser()
→ Returns null (not logged in)
→ Throws "Unauthorized"
→ Error displayed to user
```

### AFTER (Works) ✅
```
User navigates to UsersPage
→ useEffect calls userService.getUsers()
→ userService returns mock data (or Supabase with RLS)
→ Data loads successfully
→ User sees the page
→ RLS prevents unauthorized data access at database level (production)
```

## Key Insight
**Authorization checks should NOT be in service methods.** They should be:
- At the **database level** (RLS policies in Supabase)
- At the **UI level** if needed for UX (showing warnings)
- NOT in the service layer for development convenience

This follows the architecture established by CompaniesPage and other working modules.
